Crop Calculator is every farmers nifty pocket profit maximizing tool. The calculator takes into account the season, days left in season, farmer level and professions to inform you which seeds you should buy for the greatest return on investment.

I've been using a third-party tool for a while now but it's frustrating tabbing out and having to enter in-game details every time such as the day or farming level. So I decided to build it into the menu.

# Install

1. Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).
2. Download this mod and unzip the contents.
3. Place the mod in your Mods folder.
4. Run the game using SMAPI.

# How to Use

Go into your inventory and you'll notice there's a new tab on the far right with the Parsnip seed icon.

Selecting that tab will bring up the calculator.

The calculator automatically takes into account some in-game details such as the day of the season, however there are a few other parameters for you to play around with.

A graph will be shown with your estimated profits for any given crop.

Hope you make lots of money.

# Credits and Inspirations

Inspired by and extended off of [Stardew Profits](https://thorinair.github.io/Stardew-Profits/) by [Thorinair](https://github.com/Thorinair). I've been using his tool for so long and all the credit should go to him. I just wanted to use it in-game and have the form filled in automatically. Heavily relied on code from [UIInfoSuite2](https://github.com/Annosz/UIInfoSuite2/tree/master) for integration with the in-game menu, so huge thanks to [cdaragorn](https://github.com/cdaragorn) and [Annosz](https://github.com/Annosz) for their great work.
